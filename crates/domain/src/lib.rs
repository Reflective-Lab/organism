//! Organizational domain packs for Organism.
//!
//! These packs encode reusable organizational workflow patterns.
//! Each pack defines agents (suggestors), invariants, and fact prefixes
//! for a specific organizational domain.
//!
//! When wired to a Converge engine, each agent implements the `Suggestor`
//! trait from `converge-pack`. The patterns here define the organizational
//! logic; Converge enforces the axioms.
//!
//! # Packs
